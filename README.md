# APIagb

A library to manage the GBA hardware, built with C and with compatibility with C, C++ and Assembly.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to build the library and the various demos.

### Prerequisites

Install GNU make:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Read [this guide](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) to install DevkitARM.

### Building the library.

First, go to the directorie where you downloaded the library:

```bash
cd /path/to/lib/
```

And then build the library:

```bash
make APIagb
```
Or:
```bash
make lib
```

If you see a file named `libAPIagb.a`, then the build was succesfull.

You can run `make` to see the list of demos.

## Building the demos.

### Mode3Demo

This demo shows the line, circle, frame and rectangle drawing algorithms for mode 3. You can build it like this:

```bash
make Mode3Demo
```

### Mode3ImageDemo

This demo shows the image copying routine for mode 3. You can build it like this:

```bash
make Mode3ImageDemo
```

### Mode4ImageDemo

This demo shows the image and palette copying routines for mode 4, and the mode 4 page flip handler. You can build it like this:

```bash
make Mode4ImageDemo
```

### Mode5Demo

This demo shows the line, circle, frame and rectangle drawing algorithms for mode 5, and the mode 5 page flip handler. You can build it like this:

```bash
make Mode5Demo
```

### Mode5ImageDemo

This demo shows the image copying routine for mode 5, and the mode 5 page flip handler. You can build it like this:

```bash
make Mode5ImageDemo
```

## Testing on a real GBA

All the demos are builded for cartridges, but you can change this to multiboot by changing the `SPECS` variable of the demo Makefile to `gba_mb`.
